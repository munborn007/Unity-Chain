Unity Chain — Executive Summary

Unity Chain is a purpose-driven Layer-1 blockchain designed for real-world utility (UBI, identity, green incentives, low fees). Technical goals: secure, scalable, EVM-compatible, energy efficient, cross-chain and developer-friendly. Business goals: mass adoption through partnerships, grants, NGOs, and a developer ecosystem.

1 — High Level Design & Differentiators (why Unity Chain will stand out)

Hybrid design: Substrate (Rust) L1 runtime with an EVM pallet for full EVM compatibility. Native support for both ink! (Rust contracts) and Solidity (via EVM).

People-first economics: on-chain UBI + proof-of-action incentives (not just yield farming).

Green/Impact layer: validated proofs (IoT attestations, oracles) to reward sustainability actions.

Anti-Sybil identity: decentralized DID + attestation system (Verifiable Credentials) for UBI & reputation.

Interoperability: IBC-like or XCMP (Polkadot) path + EVM bridges for cross-chain liquidity.

Modular runtimes & governance: on-chain runtime upgrades via governance proposals (forkless upgrades).
